# dynamic-pixelizer
It's a dynamic pixelizer.

It uses live video from the camera to color sksprite nodes in a pixel grid. Tapping the grid starts the 2d physics simulation, using the built in accelerometer to guide the chunks. You can choose circles instead of squares (but they take longer to render). You can flip the toggle to turn live update on or off (which makes rendering circles much faster.)

# Why?
I don't know.

Here's an example:
